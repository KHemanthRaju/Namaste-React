## 3. Role of type attribute in script tag? What options can I use there?

The `type` attribute in the script tag defines the type of script that we we want to run inside our app.
`type` attribute can be of the following types:

- `text/javascript` : It is the basic standard of writing javascript code inside the `<script>` tag.

e.g

```
<script type="text/javascript">
    const a = "Hello";
    const b = "World!";
    console.log(a + " " + b); // Hello World!
</script>
```

- `text/ecmascript` : this value indicates that the script is following the `EcmaScript` standards.

- `module`: This value tells the browser that the script is a module that can import or export other files or modules inside it.

- `text/babel` : This value indicates that the script is a babel type and required bable to transpile it.

- `text/typescript`: As the name suggest the script is written in `TypeScript`.

## 4. `{TitleComponent}` vs `{<TitleComponent/>}` vs `{<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>}` in JSX.

- `{TitleComponent}`: This value describes the `TitleComponent` as a javascript expession or a variable or an element.
The `{}` can embed a javascript expression or a values inside it.

- `<TitleComponent/>` : This value represents a Component that is basically returning Some JSX value. In simple terms `TitleComponent` a function that is returning a JSX value.
A compoenet is written inside the `{<  />}` expression.

- `<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>` :  `<TitleComponent />` and `<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>` are equivalent only when `< TitleComponent />` has no children components.The opening and closing tags are created to include the child components.

e.g.

```
<TitleComponent>
    <ChildComponen1 />
    <ChildComponen2 />
    <ChildComponen3 />
</TitleComponent>
